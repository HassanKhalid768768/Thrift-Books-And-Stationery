# Payment Abandonment Solutions

## Problem
Orders were being created in the database even when users navigated back from Stripe payment without completing the payment. This happened because:

1. Order creation occurs before payment completion
2. Users navigating back via browser didn't trigger the cancel URL
3. No cleanup mechanism existed for abandoned orders

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **INSTANT** Order Cleanup in placeOrder Function
- **File**: `backend/controllers/orderController.js`
- **Change**: Clean up ALL pending orders for user instantly when placing new order
- **Purpose**: Prevents any abandoned orders from accumulating

### 2. Dedicated Cleanup Functions
- **File**: `backend/controllers/orderController.js`
- **New Functions**:
  - `cleanupAbandonedOrders()`: Removes orders older than 15 minutes with payment = false
  - `cleanupUserPendingOrders()`: **INSTANTLY** removes ALL pending orders for a specific user
  - `getPendingOrders()`: Admin endpoint to view pending orders for debugging
- **Routes**: 
  - `POST /api/orders/cleanup`: Manual cleanup trigger
  - `POST /api/orders/cleanup-user`: **INSTANT** user-specific cleanup
  - `GET /api/orders/pending`: View pending orders

### 3. Automated Cleanup Scheduler
- **File**: `backend/utils/cleanupScheduler.js`
- **Features**:
  - Runs every 15 minutes using cron job
  - Runs initial cleanup on server startup
  - Automatically removes abandoned orders
- **Integration**: Added to `server.js` startup sequence

### 4. Frontend Instant Cleanup Integration
- **File**: `frontend/src/context/StoreContext.jsx`
- **Functions**: 
  - `cleanupAbandonedOrders()`: General cleanup (15-minute threshold)
  - `cleanupUserPendingOrders()`: **INSTANT** user-specific cleanup
- **Purpose**: Allows frontend to trigger instant cleanup when users return

- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Cart.jsx`
- **Integration**: Calls **INSTANT** cleanup when cart page loads

- **File**: `frontend/src/hooks/usePaymentReturn.js`
- **Purpose**: Global detection of users returning from external payment sites
- **Features**: 
  - Detects browser back button usage
  - Monitors window focus/blur events
  - Triggers instant cleanup when users return

- **File**: `frontend/src/App.js`
- **Integration**: Global payment return detection across entire app

## How It Works

### Order Lifecycle
1. **Order Creation**: Order created with `payment: false`, `status: 'Pending Payment'`
2. **Payment Success**: Order updated to `payment: true`, `status: 'Order Confirmed'`
3. **Payment Cancel**: Order deleted immediately
4. **Payment Abandonment**: Order remains in database but gets cleaned up after 15 minutes

### Cleanup Triggers (INSTANT)
1. **New Order**: When same user places a new order - **ALL** pending orders deleted instantly
2. **Cart Visit**: When user visits cart page - **ALL** pending orders deleted instantly
3. **Browser Back Button**: When user returns via back button - **ALL** pending orders deleted instantly
4. **Window Focus**: When user returns after 30+ seconds away - **ALL** pending orders deleted instantly
5. **Automated**: Every 15 minutes via cron job (backup cleanup)
6. **Server startup**: Initial cleanup when server starts (backup cleanup)

## Installation Requirements

Install the required dependency:
```bash
cd backend
npm install node-cron
```

## Monitoring and Testing

### Check Pending Orders
```bash
# GET request to see current pending orders
curl http://localhost:4000/api/orders/pending
```

### Manual Cleanup
```bash
# POST request to manually trigger cleanup
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/orders/cleanup
```

### Database Query
```javascript
// In MongoDB, check for pending orders
db.orders.find({ payment: false }).count()
```

## Configuration

### Cleanup Interval
- **Current**: 15 minutes
- **Modify**: Change time values in:
  - `backend/controllers/orderController.js` (line 20)
  - `backend/utils/cleanupScheduler.js` (line 8)

### Cron Schedule
- **Current**: Every 15 minutes (`*/15 * * * *`)
- **Modify**: Update cron expression in `cleanupScheduler.js`

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Database Bloat**: Removes abandoned orders automatically
2. **Improved User Experience**: Users don't see duplicate orders
3. **Better Analytics**: Only completed orders remain in database
4. **System Reliability**: Automated cleanup prevents manual intervention
5. **Debugging Support**: Admin endpoints for monitoring

## Error Handling

- All cleanup functions include try-catch blocks
- Non-blocking: Cleanup failures don't affect normal order processing
- Logging: Console messages track cleanup activities
- Graceful degradation: System works even if cleanup fails

## Future Enhancements

1. **Webhook Integration**: Use Stripe webhooks for real-time payment status
2. **User Notifications**: Email notifications for abandoned carts
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track abandonment rates
4. **Configurable Timeouts**: Admin-configurable cleanup intervals
